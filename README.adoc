Running the app

1. This is a Spring Boot project & can be run with gradle or maven
    * From command line you can run the app with './gradlew bootRun' or 'mvn spring-boot:run'
    * In IntelliJ, open the project & right click on the build.gradle file & select Import Gradle Project from the list.
        * Make sure to have add SDK in the project SDK dropdown
    * Gradle can be installed on your machine with 'scoop install gradle'
2. Alternatively, the project can be run from Application.java -> main
    * This probably depends on your IDE though.
3. Another way to handle this would have been for me to run the server and allow you to access that endpoint but opening and securing a port on my own network
    seemed much more involved. Hope the app actually runs on your environment!

Accessing endpoint
1. I named the endpoint localhost://port/convertNumberToEnglish/{inputNumber} as this better describes the endpoint's purpose.
2. Use a Postman or Curl get request to access it.

Misc

1. Based on the example given, I'm returning an object that contains two strings: status & converted number
    * I could have returned the http response status but it seems cleaner to fail gracefully and use the status string to inform the user of (some) errors
    instead of responding with a generic "500 something went wrong" message.
2. Decimals and numbers over 999 septillion aren't allowed.
3. Negative numbers are fine.
4. I didn't do anything with http://localhost:8080/actuator/ endpoints because they seem like overkill for the purposes of this app
